## Discription

- A command-line application that accepts user input when the user is prompted for their team members and their information.
- Then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
- When the user clicks on an email address in the HTML the default email program opens and populates the to field of the email with the address.
- When the user clicks on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
- When the user start the application then the user is prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
- When the user enters the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
- When the user selects the engineer option then the user can be prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and the user is taken back to the menu.
- When the user selects the intern option then the user can be prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and the user is taken back to the menu.
- When the user decide to finish building their team then the user can exit the application, and the HTML is generated.

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A sample HTML file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
